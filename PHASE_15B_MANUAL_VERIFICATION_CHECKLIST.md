- [ ] Confirm all operations persist in database

### ✅ Template Integration
- [ ] Check API call to `/templates` for template list
- [ ] Select template for contract creation

- [ ] Confirm no hardcoded template data

## AI Agent System Verification

### ✅ Contract Filling
- [ ] Navigate to `/assistant`

- [ ] Check DevTools for API call to `/ai-agents/contract-fill`
- [ ] Verify real AI processing (not mock responses)
- [ ] Confirm extracted data comes from actual AI analysis
- [ ] Check for real-time progress updates

### ✅ Document Extraction
- [ ] Request document data extraction
- [ ] Check API call to `/ai-agents/document-extract`
- [ ] Verify real AI agent responses
- [ ] Confirm no hardcoded extraction results

## Real-Time Communication Verification

### ✅ WebSocket Connection
- [ ] Open DevTools Network tab, filter by WS
- [ ] Navigate to any page with real-time features
- [ ] Verify WebSocket connection to backend
- [ ] Check for real-time message exchange

### ✅ Live Updates
- [ ] Upload document in one browser tab
- [ ] Open another tab to same page
- [ ] Verify real-time processing updates appear
- [ ] Check WebSocket messages in DevTools

## Data Persistence Verification

### ✅ Database Integration
- [ ] Create contract with unique name
- [ ] Close browser completely
