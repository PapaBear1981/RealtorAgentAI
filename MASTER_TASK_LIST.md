# Master Task List - Multi-Agent Real-Estate Contract Platform

> **IMPORTANT**: This is the authoritative task list for the project. All work must be tracked here according to the Development Rules. Update task states using Augment's task management tools after completing any work.

## Task Management Rules Reference
- **Task Granularity**: ~20 minutes of professional development work per task
- **Task States**: `[ ]` NOT_STARTED, `[/]` IN_PROGRESS, `[x]` COMPLETE, `[-]` CANCELLED
- **Updates**: Use `update_tasks()` to change states, `add_tasks()` for new work
- **Specification**: All tasks must trace to specific sections in `RealEstate_MultiAgent_Spec.md`

## 🔄 Task Update Instructions

### Using Augment Task Management Tools
```bash
# View current task status
view_tasklist

# Update task states (use batch updates for efficiency)
update_tasks([
  {"task_id": "task-uuid", "state": "COMPLETE"},
  {"task_id": "next-task-uuid", "state": "IN_PROGRESS"}
])

# Add new tasks as work evolves
add_tasks([{
  "name": "New Task Name",
  "description": "Detailed description with spec reference",
  "parent_task_id": "parent-uuid-if-subtask"
}])
```

### Task State Change Rules
- **Before starting work**: Mark task as IN_PROGRESS
- **After completing work**: Mark task as COMPLETE and update next task to IN_PROGRESS
- **When blocked**: Document blocker in task description
- **When cancelled**: Mark as CANCELLED with reason in description

### Quality Checkpoints
Before marking any task COMPLETE, ensure:
- [ ] Implementation matches specification exactly
- [ ] Code follows project quality standards
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Integration points are validated
