# Master Task List - Multi-Agent Real-Estate Contract Platform

> **IMPORTANT**: This is the authoritative task list for the project. All work must be tracked here according to the Development Rules. Update task states using Augment's task management tools after completing any work.

## Task Management Rules Reference
- **Task Granularity**: ~20 minutes of professional development work per task
- **Task States**: `[ ]` NOT_STARTED, `[/]` IN_PROGRESS, `[x]` COMPLETE, `[-]` CANCELLED
- **Updates**: Use `update_tasks()` to change states, `add_tasks()` for new work
- **Specification**: All tasks must trace to specific sections in `RealEstate_MultiAgent_Spec.md`

update_tasks([
  {"task_id": "task-uuid", "state": "COMPLETE"},
  {"task_id": "next-task-uuid", "state": "IN_PROGRESS"}
])

# Add new tasks as work evolves
add_tasks([{
  "name": "New Task Name",
