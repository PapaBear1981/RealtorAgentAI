## üîÑ Task Update Instructions

### Using Augment Task Management Tools
```bash
# View current task status
view_tasklist

# Update task states (use batch updates for efficiency)
update_tasks([
  {"task_id": "task-uuid", "state": "COMPLETE"},
  {"task_id": "next-task-uuid", "state": "IN_PROGRESS"}
])

# Add new tasks as work evolves
add_tasks([{
  "name": "New Task Name",
  "description": "Detailed description with spec reference",
  "parent_task_id": "parent-uuid-if-subtask"
}])
```

### Task State Change Rules
- **Before starting work**: Mark task as IN_PROGRESS
- **After completing work**: Mark task as COMPLETE and update next task to IN_PROGRESS
- **When blocked**: Document blocker in task description
- **When cancelled**: Mark as CANCELLED with reason in description

### Quality Checkpoints
Before marking any task COMPLETE, ensure:
- [ ] Implementation matches specification exactly
- [ ] Code follows project quality standards
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Integration points are validated
